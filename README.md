# ZX Tools

Created by [Remy Sharp](https://remysharp.com) as a child of the late 70s the ZX Spectrum are his fondest memories of computing as a kid. So it only made sense that he turn his browser-based skills to made things work on the Spectrum.

Inspired by the return of Spectrum via the ZX Next, Remy learnt how loading screens worked, how the binary data in screens is arranged and presented his work in a [mad demo on stage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQMcZtiaD0A&list=PLXmT1r4krsTq3yrg4t14hPUbO1OsrA1Hx&index=8) in 2018.

The code is a little hacky (written over a few days), but has some semblance of organisation. It can be found here and is available under the [MIT license](https://rem.mit-license.org).

This project is vanilla HTML + JS project (so yes, I'm currently repeating the navigation over and oer, and it's okay!) - however if you're looking for code, it should be organised well enough to extract the function you want, I just kindly ask that you credit me, ta.
